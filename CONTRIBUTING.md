### Reporting bugs and feature requests

If you find any issues, please report them by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/equinor/APS-Facies/issues/new).
If there is something missing, or some feature you would like to see, please describe it in a [new issue](https://github.com/equinor/APS-Facies/issues/new), or better yet, submit a pull request.

If you report a bug, please provide a detailed description of the bug, how to reproduce it, which version of the plugin you are using.
If possible, please also include a **minimal** RMS project where the bug happens.
This is only relevant if the plugin is unable to handle some specific data in the RMS project.

### Improving documentation
Do you find the documentation lacking?
Please reach out, create an issue, pull request, or suggest changes.
