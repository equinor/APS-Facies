# Purpose: Copy field parameters from initial ensemble to updated ensemble.
#          This forward model can be used if for some reason the user doesn't want to
#          include all field parameters from APS into FIELD keywords in ERT,
#          but want to keep initial ensemble version of some of them instead.
#          Note: Application of this is a bit  "experimental" since the usual
#          way of handling GRF fields from APS is to update them all,
#          and not a subset of them in ERT with ES or ES-MDA.
